        <p>Sunscreens protect the skin. They play an important role in blocking ultraviolet (UV) radiation from being absorbed by the skin. </p>

        <p>Sunscreen, also known as sunblock or sun cream, is a photoprotective topical product for the skin that helps protect against sunburn and most importantly prevent skin cancer. 
            Sunscreens come as lotions, sprays, gels, foams (such as an expanded foam lotion or whipped lotion ), sticks, powders and other topical products. 
            Sunscreens are classified into two types:
            </br>
            Inorganic sunscreens (also referred to as mineral or physical), which use active ingredients that are minerals (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide). 
            These substances work by absorbing and scattering UV rays.</br>
            Organic sunscreens (also referred to as chemical or petrochemical, as the starting building block is typically derived from petroleum) which use organic 
            molecules as active ingredients and work mainly by absorbing the UV rays.
