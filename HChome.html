            <h3 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">Why Healthy Hair is important to your Overall and Well-Being?</h3>
            <p style="font-size: large;" >Your hair is important to your overall health and well-being because it is one of the first aspects that others may notice about you. How healthy and vibrant your hair is can tell someone what type of person you are, and how you feel about yourself. 
            Healthy hair is a sign of confidence and allows others to view you in a positive light.</p>
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">Boosts Self Confidence</h3>
            <p style="font-size: large;">Self-confidence is important to everyone, and the condition of our hair has a significant impact on how we view ourselves. Booking an appointment with reputable salons can revive your self-confidence and allow you to be healthy and happy with your appearance. 
            Hairstylists at salons know how to cut and style any type of hair, and have the ability to help you look your best.
            Getting your hair done by quality salons and stylists allows you to have confidence on every occasion, whether it be a get together with friends or a job interview. Confidence is key to success, and your haircut contributes to your confidence significantly.</p>
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">Promotes Healthy Hair</h3>
            <p style="font-size: large;">Healthy hair is critical to the health and well-being of the condition of your hair, as hair that is not maintained can have split ends, frizzy, and be extremely dry,
             which is neither healthy physically, nor good for your self-confidence. A hair salon will give you the correct treatments to maintain your hair so it remains in a healthy, 
            vibrant state, and allows you to have all the confidence that comes with healthy hair.
            Furthermore, even after leaving a salon, the stylist will ensure you have the right shampoo and conditioner to maintain healthy and vibrant hair until your next salon visit.</p>
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">Prevents Premature Hairloss</h3>
            <p style="font-size: large;">Maintaining your hair contains a plethora of benefits that promote both healthy hygiene and self-esteem.<br>
            However, maintaining your hair can also provide longevity, as proper maintenance can reduce the chance of premature hair loss.</p>
