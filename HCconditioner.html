            <h2>What is a Conditioner?</h2>
        A conditioner is a hair care product used after a shampoo. Apart from ingredients such as silicone, oils, and emollients, this moisturising agent also contains cationic surfactants (cleansing ingredients) that get rid of the oily elements in your hair.
         And together with these two powerful factors, a conditioner replenishes the moisture lost during shampooing.
        <h2>What are the benefits of using a Conditioner?</h2>
        Weather, frequent styling, and daily wear and tear can set the stage for hair damage. And shampoo alone cannot hold the ground. 
        Though it's designed to clean your scalp, hair, and sebum build-up, you also need something potent yet gentle,
        to replenish the lost moisture and the natural oils stripped from your hair. This is where the conditioner steps in.
        <br>
        Everything that your hair goes through daily, damages your cuticles and causes them to ultimately break. 
        The conditioner strengthens them with a protective coating, prevents breakage, and promotes hair growth.
        <br>
        Another major benefit of using a conditioner is that it moisturises your hair, and makes it soft, smooth, reduces frizz, and adds shine to your tresses.
        <h2>Which Conditioner should you use?</h2>
        Choosing the right conditioner depends largely on your hair type, structure, and thickness.

        If you have fine hair and want to add volume to your tresses, Sheer Volume Conditioner does an incredible job. 
        This lightweight, volumising conditioner is enriched with a nourishing Pro-V formula that helps you get fuller and healthier hair.
        Hair frizz is a common problem, and a majority of women wake up with a bedhead. To tame and smooth frizz-prone hair, 
        try the Smooth & Sleek Conditioner that's formulated with Pro-V nutrients to lock out humidity and help you flaunt hair that’s smooth, strong, and manageable.
        Daily wear and tear and regular heat styling can cause hair breakage. To protect your delicate tresses, use Long & Strong Conditioner to strengthen them from inside out. 
        This reduces the damage and you’ll notice a visible reduction in *hair fall.
        Different hair types need different conditioners that not only address the problems but also give you gorgeous, strong, and healthy locks. 
        Explore the wide range of Conditioners that are formulated to address your unique haircare requirements and make you ready for the good hair days.
