            <p>A body scrub is a type of skin care product that is used to clean and exfoliate the skin. It is used to remove dirt, oil, and sweat from the skin. Depending on the ingredients, body scrubs can also be effective in stimulating circulation and cleansing the pores. Body scrubs are available in a variety of textures, including granules, beads, and balls. Some scrubs are specifically designed for oily or combination skin, while others are formulated for dry skin types. </p>
                
            <p> Body scrubs are a mechanical exfoliant; it means they remove dead skin cells from the outer layer of your skin with abrasive ingredients. They can be used on all parts of the body, but are particularly effective on areas that are dry and rough, such as the elbows, knees, and feet.</p>

                    <li><b>Choose the right scent:</b> Many people like to add scents to their scrubs. Some people use fruit-based body scrubs which add a delightful fragrance to your skin. Commonly used fruit-based body scrubs are Lychee, Peach, Mango, Orange, Watermelon, and Strawberry.  If you are using a scrub for the first time, it is best to test it out before adding any scents. </li>
                    <li><b>Apply the scrub with your fingertips:</b>Once you have chosen the type of scrub and the scent, it is time to apply it to your skin. To do this, wet your skin and apply the scrub using circular motions, rinse it well with warm water and enjoy the results.</li>
                    <li><b>Apply a good moisturizer after using body scrub: </b>Putting on moisturizer while your skin is still damp will trap in the moisture that will further make your skin super soft.</li>
                </ul>
