        <h1><center> Hair Cream: What, Why and How-To?</center></h1>
        <h2>What is Hair Cream?</h2>
        Hair cream, commonly termed as styling cream, adds natural shine to rough hair. It smoothens the tamed hair and holds them well so that they don't fall. 
        In simple words, it removes frizz and fly-aways without making them heavy.However, high maintenance and party wear styles like spikes, mohawks and pompadours are not possible with creams. 
        That require a more sticky wax kind of a thing found in styling gels.
        Cream is for casual and natural finish that styles while nourishing. Hair creams are not solid like wax, or sticky like a gel, they are thick creams that works for all hair types. 
        Hair cream is especially a boon for curly and long unmanageable mane, that gets easily entangled. Applying cream boost the curls or wavy hair without weighing them down.
        <h2>Why Hair Cream?</h2>
        Just like our body, our hair needs nourishment too, and a lot of it! Oils can provide nourishment but it makes hair look sticky. Hair cream does not only fulfil styling needs but also work to make hair healthy.
        Natural ingredients like Rosemary oil, Hemp, Peppermint Oil and Almond Oil give your hair a shine and nourishment, while fighting off damage done by harmful pollution, UV rays and dirt.
        Earlier style conscious men would use a hair gel for that back-comb-hair look and add serious shine. It looked good, but felt heavy and greasy. Today's hair cream gives a more natural look. 
        Specially for dull hair, hair cream application gives a well-groomed look, effortlessly.
        <h2>How To Use Hair Cream</h2>
        Hair creams can be used before and after shampoo.<br>
        If you are applying it before shampoo, use it like any other oil, the cream strengthens the roots, conditions the hair, prevents hair fall and also promotes hair growth.<br>
        Take a dab of cream (pea size) in your palm and using fingers apply directly on the roots as well as hair.<br>
        Give a gentle massage for a minute or two and leave the cream on your hair and scalp for atleast 30 minutes before wash.<br>
        If using after shampoo, apply hair cream after you towel dry your wet hair. <br>Take some cream on your palm and after rubbing, run the hair cream through damp hair. Evenly cover all hair and style as desired using fingertips, scrunch for curly styles or smooth down with a brush for a straight look.
