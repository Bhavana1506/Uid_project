  <h2>2. Prioritize Skincare</h2>
  <p>Your skin is your body's largest organ and requires proper care and attention. Develop a skincare routine suitable for your skin type, including cleansing, toning, moisturizing, and protection from the sun. Regular exfoliation can help remove dead skin cells, unclog pores, and promote a vibrant complexion. Remember to wear sunscreen daily to protect your skin from harmful UV rays.</p>
