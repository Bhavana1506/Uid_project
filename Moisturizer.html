        <p>Moisturizing Reduces Skin Problems.It conceals Skin Blemishes - Using a daily moisturizer ensures that the skin's blemishes are camouflaged.
            It also helps to reduce the development of dryness, or helps you to revive your skin from dryness.
            Moisturizer creates a barrier between your skin and the climate, including cold, dry air that can further dry out skin.
            If you have very dry skin, you'll probably want to avoid certain ingredients and products for the sake of preserving your skin's already 
            fragile hydration balance. So,it's necessary to know your skin type.
        </p>
        <h3>Moisturizer for oily skin :-</h3>
        <p>Oily skin needs moisturizer because it helps regulate oil production. When there is no moisture, the sebaceous glands in your skin will overcompensate by 
            producing more oil to support the skin's barrier function and unbreak the oily skin cycle.
            Thus ,it is said that you need the right moisturizer to restore the balance of your sebum level .

        <h3>Moisturizer for dry skin :-</h3>
        <p>Dry skin is difficult to handle and often causes scratches, cracks.
            Moisturizers increase the hydration level in the dermal cells and keep the skin soft.
            When the skin barrier is compromised, which is what we see when it becomes dry, there's actually a low-grade chronic inflammation that occurs in the skin.
            If your skin tends to be dry,then go for thicker creams.

            When choosing good moisturizers for combination skin, the key is to go for products with mattifying ingredients and oil-free base. 
            Avoid using the same product for the oily zones and the dry areas.
            Ensure you stay away from harsh ingredients that can irritate your skin.
        </p>
        <h3>Moisturizer for sensitive skin :-</h3>
